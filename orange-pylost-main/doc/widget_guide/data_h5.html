<p>This widget is used to load custom HDF5 format files developed for the earlier PyLOSt software. The H5 file should consist of NXentries corresponding to a set of scans by an Instrument on a mirror. The H5 file may have multiple NXentry measurements and one of them has to be selected, which is loaded to a dictionary format and sent to output channel of this widget.</p>
