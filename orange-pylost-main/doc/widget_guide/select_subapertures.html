<h1>Select subapertures widget guide</h1>

But if there are more dimensions, subapertures can be selected across multiple non-detector axes seperated by ';'. The excluded subapertures can be entered with comma separation or in from -to format (e.g. 0-5). The options for this widget are shown below.</p>

<p>Scan options are visible if there are repeated scans in the data. The subaperture selection can be applied to (a) all scans, (b) current scan or (c) selected scans.</p>
<p>A checkbox 'Keep excluded subapertures and fill them with NaN' is added to retain the initial shape of data and replace unwanted subapertures with nans.</p>
