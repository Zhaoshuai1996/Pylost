<h1>Operator widgets guide</h1>
<p>Operators like Add/average, Subtract, Multiply, Divide can be used with multiple input data. The input datasets should broadcastable if not of same shape. The operations are applied in sequence, i.e. for subtraction&nbsp; A - B - C - D etc. where A,B,C,D are the inputs added in that sequence.</p>
<p>Add widget has a checkbox to scale the output by number of inputs, i.e. to calculate average.</p>
